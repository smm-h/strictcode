# strictcode foundation build log

Durable record of every material decision and every deviation from the design
corpus (`DESIGN.md`, `CATALOG.md`, `schema/SPEC.md`) made during the autonomous
foundation build (started 2026-08-03). Per DESIGN.md §12 ("Foundation build
execution"), the builder session has full decision-making authority inside this
repository and must record its decisions here.

Format: dated entries, newest last. Each entry states the decision, the
rationale, and whether it deviates from a design document.

**Go module and toolchain.** Module `github.com/smm-h/strictcode`, `go 1.26.3`
(the installed toolchain). No deviation.

**LICENSE.** Apache 2.0, verbatim from apache.org. Explicitly approved by the
owner in the build charter; DESIGN.md §11 lists it as a settled fact. No
deviation.

**SARIF todo.** Filed directly in `todo/.defer/` per DESIGN.md §10 (SARIF output
deferred; "todo filed in `todo/.defer/` at repo scaffolding time").
